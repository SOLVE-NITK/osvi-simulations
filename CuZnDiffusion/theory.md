## Theory

The diffusion of copper in zinc involves the movement of zinc atoms through the copper lattice structure. This process can be described by Fick's laws of diffusion, which are mathematical expressions governing the rate of diffusion of substances through a medium. Specifically, the diffusion of copper in zinc can be understood through the following principles:

- **Fick's First Law**: This law states that the rate of diffusion of a substance is directly proportional to the concentration gradient of that substance. In the case of zinc diffusion in copper, this means that the rate of diffusion of copper atoms is higher when there is a greater difference in zopper concentration between two points in the zinc lattice.

- **Fick's Second Law**: This law describes how the concentration profile of a diffusing substance changes over time. It states that the rate of change of concentration with respect to time is proportional to the second derivative of concentration with respect to distance. In simpler terms, it explains how the distribution of zinc atoms within the copper lattice evolves over time as diffusion occurs.

- **Activation Energy**: Diffusion also depends on the activation energy required for atoms to move through the lattice structure. Higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of atoms, making them more likely to overcome energy barriers and facilitating diffusion. This is described by the Arrhenius equation, which relates diffusion rate to temperature and activation energy.

- **Atomic Size and Lattice Structure**: The diffusion rate of zinc in copper is influenced by the atomic size of zinc compared to copper and the crystal lattice structure of copper. Zinc atoms are smaller than copper atoms, which can affect the ease of movement within the lattice. Additionally, the specific crystal structure of the copper lattice can influence the pathways available for zinc diffusion.

In summary, the diffusion characteristics of zinc in copper are governed by Fick's laws of diffusion, which describe how the concentration of zinc atoms changes over time and space within the copper lattice. Factors such as temperature, activation energy, atomic size, and lattice structure play crucial roles in determining the rate and mechanism of diffusion.
