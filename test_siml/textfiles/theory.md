# Roasting of Sphalerite Concentrate in Presence of Lime And Steam

## Theory

This experiment serves as a practical demonstration of sustainable metal processing techniques, emphasizing the importance of chemical principles in developing environmentally friendly industrial practices.

It demonstrates an innovative approach to sulfide oxidation, utilizing the interaction between metal sulfides, lime, and steam to transform sulfides into oxides without emitting sulfur-containing pollutants. The fundamental chemical reactions involved in this process can be summarized as follows:

### Sulfide Oxidation by Steam

Metal sulfides, such as zinc sulfide (ZnS), react with steam (H2O) to form metal oxides and hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S).

Example reaction: ZnS(s) + H2O(g) → ZnO(s) + H2S(g)

### Hydrogen Sulfide Reaction with Lime

Hydrogen sulfide gas produced from sulfide oxidation reacts with lime (CaO) to form calcium sulfide (CaS) and regenerate steam.

Example reaction: CaO(s) + H2S(g) → CaS(s) + H2O(g)

### Overall Reaction

Combining the above reactions results in the desired overall reaction:

ZnS(s) + CaO(s) → ZnO(s) + CaS(s)

In this experiment, the sphalerite concentrate is mixed with lime in a controlled environment and subjected to a specific temperature regime. The introduction of steam initiates the desired chemical reactions, ultimately leading to the formation of zinc oxide (ZnO) and calcium sulfide (CaS) in the roasted product (calcine).

The analysis of the calcine post-roasting provides valuable insights into the efficacy of the sulfide oxidation process. By confirming the presence of zinc oxide, researchers can demonstrate the successful conversion of sulfides to oxides, highlighting the potential environmental benefits of innovative approach.
