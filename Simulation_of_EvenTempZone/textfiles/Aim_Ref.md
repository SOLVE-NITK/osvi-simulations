# Aim: Finding the Even Temperature Zone of a Tubular Furnace

The aim of the experiment is to identify and characterize the even temperature zone within a tubular furnace. This zone represents a region where the temperature remains relatively constant, which is crucial for ensuring uniform conditions during processes like material synthesis or heat treatment.
